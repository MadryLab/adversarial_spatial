# Adversarial rotations and translations for CIFAR10

This repository contains code to train and evaluate CIFAR10 models against
adversarially chosen rotations and translations (code for ImageNet at https://github.com/MadryLab/spatial-pytorch). It can be used to reproduce the
main experiments of:

The main scipts to run are `train.py` and `eval.py`, which will train and
evaluate a model respectively. Options are all included in `config.json`
annotated below.

Data augmentation only included random left-right flips. Standard CIFAR10
augmentation (+-2 pixel crops) can be achieved by setting
`adversarial_training: true`, `spatial_method: random`, `random_tries: 1`,
`spatial_limits: [2, 2, 0]`.
